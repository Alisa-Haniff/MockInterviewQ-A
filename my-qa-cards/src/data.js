    question: 'How would you approach debugging a complex piece of code that is not working as expected?',
    answer: 'When faced with debugging a complex piece of code, my first step is to gain a thorough understanding of the expected behavior and the current issue. I would start by reviewing any available documentation or discussing the problem with colleagues who are familiar with the code. Once I have a clear grasp of the issue, I would begin isolating the problematic section by using a systematic approach such as binary search or divide-and-conquer. This involves breaking down the code into smaller segments and testing each part individually to identify where the error occurs. Utilizing debuggers and logging tools can be invaluable during this process, as they help track variable values and monitor the execution flow.'

    question: 'How do you handle constructive criticism of your code? ',
    answer: 'I welcome constructive criticism of my code, especially during this learning phase of my career. I believe that feedback is essential for growth and development as a programmer. When I receive constructive criticism, I take it as an opportunity to learn and improve. I actively listen to the feedback, ask questions if something isnâ€™t clear, and reflect on how I can apply that feedback to enhance my coding skills. I appreciate the insights and perspectives of others, as they can help me identify areas I may not have considered and lead to better solutions. Overall, I view constructive criticism as a valuable tool that enables me to become a more effective and skilled developer.'

    question: 'What is your process for writing and testing code? ',
    answer: 'My process for writing and testing code begins with understanding the requirements of the project. I often like to draw diagrams to visualize the structure and flow of the code. This helps me clarify where to start and identify what needs to be done. Once I have a clear plan, I write the code in small, manageable increments, focusing on one piece of functionality at a time. After implementing a section, I immediately test it to ensure it works as intended. I find that testing early and often helps catch issues before they become more significant problems. Overall, I believe that clear planning, continuous testing, and collaboration with my team are key components of my coding process.'
